# Unity-JRPG
An very simple pokemon inspired JRPG made using Unity

# A bit of rant
I made this project because i was curious about Unity. I thought this is the right tools for me, apparantely not. It took me 1 week to learn the basic and made the character movement + animation and it took me another week to implement turn based combat and it took me another week to implement dialogue system. Now, i'm dealing with quest and inventory system issue yet it took way longer than i thought. This is why i'm abandoning this project, it's just too much work for a single man like me. I haven't even implemented the game story, character, and quests so even if i forced myself to keep this up it would probably won't end well. UPDATE,  i just finished it, i don't believe it, i did it. Nevermind my rant, it just took way longer than i expected.

# About the Project
This is a pokemon / jrpg like game. I made this using unity with several plugins such as Fungus (for dialogue) and Standard Unity Asset Store (for camera and character movement). I also added turn based combat, pretty much using scripts, and for skillset for both player and enemy can be added just by duplicating existing script. For the character movement animation, i used the animator and animation tools in Unity, i spliced the Character Spritesheet and i put them in animation for each direction and incorporated it with the movement script on animator tools.

For more details you can check out the screenshots that i took.
